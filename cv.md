## Briefly about Myself:
Inspired by the magic of Python, SQL, regular expressions and VBA, constantly automating office processes and routines. 
Creating time to reach new horizons.

Writing Python scripts, VBA macros and programming is like putting together a Lego set. Every time you build the same parts from scratch, you end up with a completely new thing. It seems to me that it is time to make a list of my skills in office automation, because my Lego-constructor details are getting too much. I will update the [list](https://whimsical.com/automation-R6BgicERRzeY2Ckf2Sepr4).

And now I start my journey into the exciting world of frontend
